      <h1>About lil ol' me</h1>
      <p className="aboutme">
        I&apos;m a very fidgety person. I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s that bad
        of an issue but it&apos;s hard for me to go a long time without doing
        something with hands. I say it&apos;s a good thing because that&apos;s
        the reason why I&apos;ve gotten to try and stick with so many hobbies
        over the years. That and I steal every hobby my older sister shows an
        interest in and make it my entire personality.{" "}

      <h2>Photography</h2>
      <p className="aboutme">
        I first started doing photography in seventh grade by taking pictures on
        my 5th generation iPod touch and editing them using whatever app was
        free on the app store at the time. I made a lot of pictures that were
        heavily inspired by tumblr aesthetics and default iPhone wallpapers. In
        the moment I thought they were the most beautiful pictures that my{" "}
        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/arshaddmohammad/">instagram</a>{" "}
        followers had the honor of viewing but in exposing myself more and more
        to actual, professional photographers&apos; works I realized how wrong I
        was. This didn&apos;t slow me down though, I had so much fun in this
        process I just kept taking pictures and editing them trying to make
        every new picture better than the last. I still do that today, and
        though I am much harder on myself about the art I create I am still in
        love with the act of photographing and don&apos;t plan on stopping any
        time soon.

      <h2>Birding</h2>
      <p className="aboutme">
        This one is a new one that has consumed me mind, body, and soul. I was
        helping my sister with her residency interview prep when she mentioned
        her hobby was birding. This came as a shock to me because I had always
        considered it a hobby that would only appeal to retired, wise elders but
        seeing my sister so enthralled with it naturally made me feel fomo and I
        just had to try it out for myself.
      </p>
      <p className="aboutme">
        Fast forward to my very first birding sesh (on my birthday!) in Santa
        Cruz, where I brought a little notepad my roommate bought for me in
        Hawaii with a list of some birds I was hoping to spot. We hiked around
        for about some 20 minutes without spotting a single bird. I could hear
        them but not see them, it felt like every single bird there had grouped
        up with a personal vendetta against me. That was until we noticed a
        large clearing coming up on the trail. The birds got louder and louder
        and the trail got steeper and steeper as we kept walking up towards it.
        The trail ended at a cliff and below this cliff was one of the most
        beautiful lakes I had ever seen with dozens of Brandt cormorants flying
        all over the water and resting in the trees. If you&apos;ve seen How To
        Train Your Dragon 2, I was Hiccup discovering all the dragons flying
        around in the Land of the Dragons.
      </p>
      <p className="aboutme">
        Thinking that was the highlight of my first birding experience and
        nothing could top that, we turned around to walk back to the parking
        lot. As soon as we walked maybe five feet back up the trail a large
        Red-shouldered Hawk flew up and sat right in the branch of a tree in
        front of us. I had never seen a hawk up so close and for so long before.
        It sat there for about five minutes before swooping right above our
        heads and flying back to wherever the{" "}

        was.
      </p>
      <p className="aboutme">
        That first experience was enough to get me hooked on birding. Ever
        since, I have enjoyed finding and learning more about all the different
        types of birds that I paid little mind to before. The world is a vast
        and extraordinary place when we pay just a little more attention to it.{" "}

      <h2>Movies</h2>
      <p className="aboutme">
        I love watching movies! My family and I are big movie people, we went
        from watching one movie every friday night to almost every night. My
        parents' most prized posession is their makeshift theater room in what
        should technically be our dining room, complete with a bose surround
        sound system and 120" projecter screen setup. I'm not particulary great
        at writing (as you can probably tell) but I really want to get better so
        I try to practice by writing reviews of the movies I watch on{" "}
        <a href="https://letterboxd.com/arshaddmohammad/">letterboxd</a>! I also
        just love being able to keep track of every single movie I've seen,
        when, and who I saw it with :&#41;

      <h2>Guitar</h2>
      <p className="aboutme">
        I play the guitar. No exclamation point, nothing worth being excited
        about. I am so bad. But nothing beats the feeling of getting to hear a
        song you love from your own hands, even if it might be wildly out of
        tempo. Here's a{" "}

        of every song I have learned and forgotten.
